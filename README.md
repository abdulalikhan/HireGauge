# How does HireGauge improve the recruitment process?
According to a study by ManpowerÂ®, approximately 72.8% of employers are having a hard time finding skilled candidates. This means that finding suitable candidates is becoming an increasingly serious problem. Our application can tackle this issue by making potential employees take multiple-choice examinations that are essentially skill-based assessments. The exams are composed of questions aimed at gauging a specific skill. Depending on the employer's requirement for a particular work role, the exam may contain one or more questions aimed at measuring a particular skill. For instance, if the position of an HR Manager is vacant at a software house called ABC, the assessments presented to candidates may contain more questions that gauge communication skills than other skills such as contextualizing. 

Potential employees will not be judged on the basis of their overall score on the assessments, rather they will be judged in each individual skill area. For example, if two candidates, Hadi and Aamir, appear for an HR Manager assessment, and they score 88 and 85 points out of a hundred respectively, then these scores will not be the only determining factor. Assuming that Hadi scores fewer points than Aamir on the communication skills portion of the test, then the employer may prefer Aamir over Hadi as the work role may be heavily dependent on this skill area. The hiring process is also further simplified by an intelligent candidate comparison feature that will use past employer hiring data to find patterns and semi-automate the hiring procedure.
